Jet is a system bus on steroids.

The event based architecture keeps network traffic low and peers up-to-date. 
Powerful "database-style" filters and sorting options let peers get the data they want (and nothing more).
Jet is fully web-enabled and compatible with modern browser out of the box.
It's simplicity and efficiency make Jet also suitable for devices with rather limited resources like RaspberryPi.
