Jet is a lightweight system bus for easily creating distributed web-enabled applications.

The event based architecture keeps network traffic low and peers up-to-date. 
REST/SQL-inspired filters and sorting options let peers get the data they want (and nothing more).
Jet is fully web-enabled and compatible with modern browsers out of the box.
It's simplicity and efficiency make Jet also suitable for devices with
rather limited resources like [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).
